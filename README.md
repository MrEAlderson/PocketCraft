# PocketCraft
PocketCraft is abandoned protocol hack for Bedrock to Java Edition
It used to work pretty well, but I've lost any interest on working further on this project while working on supporting a newer Bedrock version.
By this the project broke and won't work any further unless updated by anyone.
It worked pretty well back then and translated 70% of all packets properly.
Currently it only supports MC1.8.*, but it was built so it'd support any Java version.
It's possible to run it as a Spigot plugin but also as a standalone software as well.
You're free to do whatever you want with this project. You may even want to integrate some useful systems into Geyser.
